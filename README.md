Thi is a submission reminder app that will remind students to submit their assignments.
So i inserted all information i was instructed to put in whereas,i created the creat_environment.sh which consist a script that creates the subdirectories and its files and then i gave it the execution permissions and i executed. After that i inserted the given information in the files of the subdirectories.
After that i write a script in the start.sh which will help to run the app.
After that i gave execution permissions to the file and i excecuted only the startup.sh file to run the app.
and then i did the git commit and pushed.
